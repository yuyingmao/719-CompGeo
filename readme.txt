trapezoidalmap.py is the python program implementing the Randome Incremental Algorithm for solveing trapezoidal mapping problem. it reads the bounding box and line segments from an inputfile, performs the algorithm, and print out the corresponding matrix. a plot will be printed out as well.

usage:
    python sweeplinesegment.py inputfile

to make the results visualized, a library call 'matplotlib' is imported in this program
for more information: https://matplotlib.org/index.html

to install matplotlib:
    python -m pip install -U matplotlib
